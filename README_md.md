## project-summary-overview
In the dynamic landscape of global entrepreneurship, unicorn startup companies—those achieving a valuation of $1 billion or more—have garnered significant attention for their rapid growth and disruptive impact across industries. This case study delves into the factors that contribute to the success or challenges faced by unicorn companies, drawing insights from key metrics including the date of achieving unicorn status, country of origin, frequent investors, and industry focus.
We will be looking at data of Unicorn companies, seeing what factors most highly correlated with company growth/decline. We'll compare the 2022 valuation with the 2024 and see what starting fundamentals highly correlated with growth. The factors we will be delving into are: Date of Achieved Unicorn Status, Country of Origin, Frequent Investors, and Industry Focus.
