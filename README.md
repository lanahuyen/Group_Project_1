## üåü Background

Unicorn companies, privately held startups with valuations above 1 billion USD, have significantly impacted global entrepreneurship by creating innovative solutions and driving economic growth. This project aims to analyze the growth rates of unicorn companies from 2022 to 2024, focusing on their industry, location, date joined, and investors. By understanding these factors, stakeholders can gain insights into the dynamics influencing unicorn companies and identify key trends that contribute to their success.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Using datasets of unicorn companies, we analyze the growth of these companies versus multiple variables. Our analysis involves examining the growth trends based on industry, geographic location, and date of attaining unicorn status. We also investigate the impact of investors on the growth rates of these companies. The ultimate goal is to provide an understanding of the factors that influence the growth and success of unicorn companies.

## üìä Data Sources

The data for this analysis was sourced from multiple repositories, primarily Kaggle and CB Insights. The datasets include:

- **unicorn_startups_sept_2022.csv**: Contains unicorn company data as of September 2022.
- **unicorn_startups_may_2024.xlsx**: Contains unicorn company data as of May 2024.
- **unicorn_startups_july_2023.csv**: Contains unicorn company data as of July 2023.

These datasets include information on company valuations, industries, geographic locations, dates of attaining unicorn status, and investors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Processing

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

1. **Filtering Industries**: We retained only the rows where the "Industry" column matched a predefined list of relevant and emerging sectors such as Artificial Intelligence, E-commerce, Cybersecurity, etc.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Rows with missing values in critical columns like ‚Äú2022_Valuation,‚Äù ‚Äú2023_Valuation,‚Äù or ‚Äú2024_Valuation‚Äù were removed to ensure a complete and accurate dataset for analysis.
3. **Converting Valuation Data**: The valuation columns, initially in string format with dollar signs and commas, were converted to numeric values for accurate calculations.

### Growth Calculation

We calculated the percentage growth for three periods:
- **22 Growth**: The percentage change from 2022 to 2023 valuations.
- **23 Growth**: The percentage change from 2023 to 2024 valuations.
- **Total Growth**: The overall percentage change from 2022 to 2024 valuations.

### Merging Data

The first step involved merging data from different files to create a merged dataset. This was done in the `merged_df_setup.ipynb` notebook. The merged dataset was then used for further analysis and visualization.
